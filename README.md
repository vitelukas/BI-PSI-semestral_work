# BI-PSI-semestral_work

**This repository is used for a version control of a semestral work for a Computer Networks course.**

* The goal of the semestral work is to implement a server, based on the TCP protocol, for a communication between the server and a client.
* The server should be able to connect with the client ( robot ), authenticate him, and then navigate the robot towards the goal destination [0, 0] on a 2D grid.
  * There are also obstacles on the 2D grid which the robot has to evade.
  * When the robot get to the goal destination he picks up a secret message and then the server logs him out.
